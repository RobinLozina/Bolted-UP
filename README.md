# Projet-Info

1. DESCRIPTION

This project was built to help students from our school when they will need to size a screw/nut. By entering specific parameters, our website gives you back
all the dimensions needed according to 4 differents standards. These standards are the ISO one, Whitworth, Trapezoidal and Round.

2. INSTALL AND RUN

To launch our application you will need to install certain things :

- An IDE like VS Code                                               see here : https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- A Python interpreter for your IDE
- Python and the module Flask, JSON, CSV and Numpy                  see here : https://www.python.org/downloads/

After that, you can open the folder on your IDE and RUN the python file. It will give you in the terminal a PORT on your PC in which you can access the website.

3. HOW TO USE

To use our application, simply scroll to the "Filetage" section in which you will find buttons. By clicking on those buttons, you will be able to choose between 
different parameters for your use. Finally, clicking on "Calculer !" will display a table containing the response or an error message if the table is empty.
